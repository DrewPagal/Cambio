# Guide on how to play Cambio/Cambiar
## A lesser known but very fun card game
Cambio is a game of unknown origin and is a somewhat obscure card game. Many lists pertaining to card games often do not include this game simply because of its obscurity. But that does not remove from the fun in the game.

Reportedly, there are a few games that share the same name. The one that will be detailed may not be the variation you are looking for.  

### Goal
To have the least amount of points  

### Requirements
- Standard deck of cards (jokers included)
- Multiple people (So long as there is a sizable card stack to draw from) (4 starting cards per person)

### Card values and properties  
Each card has a certain value and property  

#### Values
- Ace to king: 1-13pts
- Joker: 0pt
- Red King: -1pt

#### Properties
You may chose to play these or not
(Refers to any suit unless specified otherwise)
- 7 or 8: Look at one of your cards
- 9 or 10: Look at one of someone else's card
- Jack or Queen: Blind switch with a card of your own and someone else's card
- Black king: Look at one of your cards and another players card and switch

### Setup
1. With a shuffled deck, every player is given 4 cards (serves as the starting hand)
2. Each player organizes their cards in a 2x2 pattern (alternatively, just do it however you want so long as you do not move them with the desire to trick opponents)

3. Place the rest of the cards in a deck to draw from
4. Determine the player turn order
   Clockwise, counterclockwise, et cetera

### Play
1. Everyone looks at two of their cards to try and memorize for future use
2. The player whose turn it is draws a card and looks at it
- They can decide to play it and put it in a  throwaway pile, which would activiate and properties if they desire
- OR they can decide to switch it with one of their cards and activate the switched card's property
- Special rule: If you know a value of your card or your opponents card and it is the same as the card being played, you may grab that card and place it in the pile. If you do it to your own hand, you would have one less card to worry about. If you do it to another person's hand, give a card from your hand to them.
3. Keep playing until someone says "cambio" at the start of their turn
- Skip the person who said cambio and play one more round. You cannot change the cambio person's hand
4. Reveal cards. The person with the total lowest value wins.
